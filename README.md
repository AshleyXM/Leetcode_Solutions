Record my solutions to LeetCode problems

***Note:** The solutions are not necessarily optimal.*

***Note:*** The cost information in each problem is for reference only, since I found that even if it was submitted with exactly the same code at different times, the time efficiency and memory efficiency will vary a lot.

| Problem ID  | Problem Description | My Solution | Difficulty | Problem Type | Accepted Date | Note |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [0001](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [Two Sum](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0001/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0001/Solution.java) | Easy | Array, Hash Table | 5/23/2023 |  |
| [0002](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | [Add Two Numbers](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0002/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0002/Solution.java) | Medium | Linked List, Math, Recursion | 6/15/2023 | I made a mistake in this problem which cost me a long time to fix it: Changing the pointer of the next node DOES NOT mean having changed the next pointer of the current node. In detail, we have to use "node.next = newNode"; however, "node = node.next; node = newNode" will not work.<br />The solution 2 is really ingenious and its logic is really easy to understand. |
| [0003](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0003/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0003/Solution.java) | Medium | String, Hash Table, Sliding Window | 5/23/2023 |  |

E.g. "rvs <= (Integer.MAX_VALUE - remainder) / 10" is equivalent to "rvs * 10 + remainder <= Integer.MAX_VALUE" (but the latter one will not work). |
| [0008](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/) | [String to Integer (atoi)](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0008/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0008/Solution.java) | Medium | String | 6/15/2023 |  |

| [0013](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/) | [Roman to Integer](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0013/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0013/Solution.java) | Easy | String, Math, Hash Table | 5/25/2023 |  |

| [0049](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) | [Group Anagrams](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0049/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0049/Solution.java) | Medium | Array, Hash Table, String, Sorting | 6/22/2023 | The main idea of the solution is a little similar to [0036](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0036/Problem.md). |
| [0053](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) | [Maximum Subarray](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0053/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0053/Solution.java) | Medium | Array, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming | 6/18/2023 | |

| [0056](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/) | [Merge Intervals](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0056/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0056/Solution.java) | Medium | Array, Sorting | 6/22/2023 | Similar to [0057](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0057/Problem.md). The method to sort the 2d array and the method to convert a list into an array are really subtle!!! |
| [0057](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/) | [Insert Interval](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0057/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0057/Solution.java) | Medium | Array | 6/19/2023 | A little bit tricky!

It is not worth a try since if you would like to use binary search, you would find that the time complexity is the same as the brutal-force method, which is sequential search. |
| [0083](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/) | [Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0083/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0083/Solution.java) | Easy | Linked List | 6/14/2023 | |

(DFS in Tree) |
| [0098](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/) | [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0098/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0098/Solution.java) | Medium | Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Search Tree, Binary Tree | 6/26/2023 | The first solution is a little bit tricky about the initial minimum and maximum value, since the value of the node can be Integer.MIN_VALUE or Integer.MAX_VALUE. |

| [0101](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/) | [Symmetric Tree](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0101/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0101/Solution.java) | Easy | Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree | 6/6/2023 | Tree-related. Quite interesting. |
| [0104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/) | [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0104/Problem.md) | [Java](https://github.com/AshleyXM/Leetcode_Solutions/blob/main/0104/Solution.java) | Easy | Tree, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Binary Tree | 6/9/2023 |  |

One tricky point of this problem is that, once we update the value of a list, the original reference will update at the same time. To be more specific, "result.add(current);", where both result and current are of type List, if we update the value of current, then the value of result will update. |
